      <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
      <p>There is no doubt about the enormous benefits of specialization for mankind. However, specialism and generalism are complements and should exist in balance. I explore the benefits of eclectic thinking and argue that interdisciplinarity is inevitable for our knowledge society. I propose, among other things, that this can be enhanced by more diverse curricula, cooperation and an extended review-process in academia. The biggest impact, however, comes from individual action.</p>

      <h2 id="prolog">Prologue</h2>  
      <div class="epigraph">
        <blockquote>
          <p>A person is not likely to be a good economist who is nothing else.</p>

      <p>Traditional economics has a broad, aggregated view. From a macroeconomic perspective, we might say China lowers tariffs or Germany invests in renewable energy. However, since at least the 1950s macroeconomics has been explained more and more by a micro-based approach. Indeed, newer schools emphasize rigorous microeconomic foundations.</p>
      <p>This is the notion I want to follow: We talk about financial market regulations, revitalized governments, the danger of resurrecting protectionism – but behind all these abstract institutions stand always <em>individuals</em>. Individuals who decide with their own beliefs and own incentives.</p>
      <p>I will therefore focus on a meta-topic of economics, a dynamic at the very core of human behavior: <em>the case for eclectic empowerment</em>.<label for="sn-mw-entry" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-mw-entry" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">From the Merriam-Webster dictionary: <br><em>eclectic</em> – 1: selecting what

      <h2>The case for eclectic empowerment</h2>
      <p>There is no doubt about the benefits of specialization. In fact, some argue that specialization is the core of progress. Since the industrial revolution mankind’s achievements have exploded and the complexity of our world—economically, politically, scientifically—has grown exponentially. Arguably the first to theorize about a “natural” specialization of humanity is Plato in his magnum opus <em>The Republic</em>. Economic theories such as Adam Smith’s <em>division of labor</em><label for="sn-smith" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-smith" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In his most famous work <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776)</span>, David Ricardo’s <em>comparative advantage</em><label for="sn-ricardo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-ricardo" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ricardo, D. (1821). <em>On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.</em></span> or more recent the <em>long tail</em><label for="sn-anderson" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-anderson" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Anderson, C. (2004). <em>The Long Tail</em>. In: Wired, Oct 2004</span> all describe the technological progress and gain in productivity of specialization.</p>
      <p>This is why we are so successful; this is the single most important factor for prosperity. However, it comes at a price.</p>
      <p>Bernard Mandeville formulated his economic theses in the (in)famous <em>The Fable of the Bees</em> (1714) in a way, that would cause outrage even today. Indeed, the moral aspects of specialization are, in the extreme, problematic such as ignoring human dignity in monotonous work.</p>
      <p>Yet I see the real issue somewhere else. The ubiquitous and unquestioned presence of specialization poses a threat to its complement: <em>generalism</em>.</p>
      <p>As the word complement suggests, specialism and generalism are not antagonists and rather like the concept of <em>yin yang</em>: complementary within a greater whole. Or with a more Western background: “contraria non contradictoria sed complementa sunt” (opposites are not contradictory but complementary) articulated by Niels Bohr, Nobel Price winner in physics (1922) and founder of quantum mechanics. The balance between them, however, seems to be skewed towards the former.</p>
      <p>Mark Eyskens, professor and a former prime minister of Belgium, articulates our perturbed perception of a specialist-generalist antithesis:<label for="sn-eyskens" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-eyskens" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In a speech at the International Association of University Presidents. Transcript available <a href="http://www.eyskens.com/page103/page130/page131/page131.html">online</a>.</span></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Because either you try to look out over the parapets, which surround the “vegetable garden” of your knowledge, in which case you are derisorily termed a “generalist,” a dabbling dilettante, someone who knows less and less about more and more. Or you dig ever more deeply into the soil of your own vegetable garden, and then you are referred to sarcastically as a narrow-minded specialist, someone who knows more and more about less and less.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is even present in our everyday life, as generalism, unlike the antonym specialism, is not listed in the Merriam-Webster, the American Heritage or many other dictionaries. Everyone quotes on more or less apposite occasions the aphorism: <em>Jack of all trades, but master of none</em>.<label for="sn-jack-trades" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-jack-trades" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Interesting enough, there is an alleged complete phrase: <em>Jack of all trades, master of none, though often better than a master of one</em>.</span> This saying exists in many other languages with predominantly negative connotations.<label for="sn-jack-examples" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-jack-examples" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Spanish: <em>Aprendiz de todo, maestro de nada</em>; German: <em>Hansdampf in allen Gassen</em>; French: <em>Touche-à-tout et bon à rien</em>;</span></p>
     <p>Our business world is not different. Many companies claim, but few are able, to retain their niche-market focus while simultaneously keeping an eye on “synergies” with their tangents. Similarly, employees in the human resource department acknowledge the benefits of generalists, but they “would not know where to put them”.</p>
     <p>To sum up: We have yet to overcome the stigma of generalism.</p>
     <p>Before we go on, we must first address the question <em>why</em> the cohesion of specialism and generalism is important.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Benefits and interdisciplinarity</h2>
      <p>As we explored, niche interest has taken over. Yet our modern knowledge society has diverted from established paradigms and the trend to reinstate political and economic boundaries requires both my aspired mindset.</p>
      <p>It holds for academia, politics or the business world: A true <em>inter</em>-disciplinary approach goes beyond a simple <em>multi</em>-disciplinary get-together, because it implies understanding and learning from each other. It implies raising new, unasked questions. It requires more time and flexibility and it implies challenging one’s basic principles and beliefs, which are some of the main reasons why many groups oppose this idea. However, criticising it as superficial misses the point, because it is by definition broader than a single subject and aims at a different purpose. <em>Interdisciplinary does not replace our current framework; it augments it</em>.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Creative Generalist Manifesto</em> Steve Hardy elucidates the various roles of a creative generalist:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="img/creative-generalist.png">
        <label for="mn-mc-manifesto" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-mc-manifesto" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"><em>What do generalists do?</em> Steve Hardy, Creative Generalist Manifesto, 2005.</span>
      </figure>
      <p>The benefits can be groundbreaking. Two of the most coveted qualities of modern organizations and vigorous thinkers are ingenuity and entrepreneurial talent. Creativity and innovation are also two of the most exploited buzzwords, which in my opinion confirms their significance. Frans Johanssen unfolds the benefits of combining things in his book <em>The Medici Effect</em>. And as Hardy elaborates,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>if breakthrough insights are at the intersection of ideas, concepts and cultures, it will be generalists—those so-called dabblers and experts of nothing—who find them, who connect them with the specialists that need them, who shape organizations in ways that embrace them, and who shepherd into existence the ideas that will indeed change our world for the better.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Following up, most of our problems cannot be explained by a single entity and this is especially true for global matters. The current financial crisis, for instance, has clearly to be considered from an economic point of view. Yet it takes more than one swallow to make a summer. Certainly the psychological aspects play a big role in explaining people’s behavior. We might remember certain ethical discussions; hence a more philosophical approach might contribute substantially. Moreover, a sociologist could bring insights of how people invest and what role money plays in society. As well as we must not forget the political constraints. Bottom line: If we concentrate our resources solely on economic research, our findings would improve. But it will <em>not</em> explain the crisis satisfactory.</p>
      <p>We can only speculate about a more open-minded world. Yet, as so many problems come down to openmindedness, it is hard not to imagine a spillover effect following a more generalistic approach. I find, that one who does live eclectically is, by character, inclined towards a more harmonious world.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>How to interconnect</h2>
      <p>We realized that a broad mindset is beneficial. The million-dollar question remains: How to encourage eclectic thinking?</p>
      <p>To start with, let me pose another question: Can an education system that, from the beginning, is geared to the acquisition of specialist knowledge really foster eclectic thinking?</p>
      <p>So much comes down to education and sadly, I’ve heard and experienced far too often how it kills our natural curiosity. <em>In jedem Menschen steckt etwas von einem ermordeten Mozart</em>; which is hard to translate, so to paraphrase it: Every human being starts by nature with a lot of creativity, only to lose it.</p>
      <p>We need some bright lights to introduce little improvements that steer in the eclectic direction. Simply stacking many disciplines together will not be enough, because then we'll end up with many, though isolated subjects.</p>
      <p>Neuroscientists confirm that there are substantial differences in how people absorb new inputs<label for="sn-carson-etal" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-carson-etal" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For example, Carson S.H., Peterson J.B. & Higgins D.M. (2003). Decreased Latent Inhibition Is Associated With Increased Creative Achievement in High-Functioning Individuals. <em>J Personality Soc Psychol 85</em>. 499-506.</span> and as the brain is often metaphorically referred to as a muscle, I suggest, we have to work out more our eclectic skills.</p>
      <p>Eclectic empowerment includes individual willingness to take part in a role change. So could for example an aspiring lawyer benefit from in an internship outside his profession. Institutions in urban areas should stimulate more activities in the countryside. MBA students should be encouraged to take courses beyond economics.</p>
      <p>Symposia are, in my opinion, one of the best ways in bringing together people with different backgrounds. Corporations could launch diverse internal think tanks and encourage closer cooperation horizontally, but also vertically. An unusual example is the BMW plant in Leipzig in Germany: The unique architecture of the main hall allows for exchange and openness. From the description: “The Central Building connects the production areas, offers space for meetings and communication and gives an understanding of production.” Politicians should make traveling easier and getting a permit less of a chore, so we can learn from other cultures.</p>
      <p>Scientists often fear to appear unprofessional if they work interdisciplinary. The crucial factor here are incentives. Therefore, to tackle this academic problem, I offer following idea: The reputation of a scientist should not solely dependent from a small, closed circle of experts. Journals could include more reviewers from other fields of study. Rankings could encourage scientists to publish their results in a periodical of a different discipline or in popular press. Higher education should include assignments, where e.g. students learn to write a memo for policy-makers, to train these sorts of skills.</p>
      <p>Important for interdisciplinarity is also a physical proximity. However, there is no point in installing vast science cluster if everyone works at cross-purpose. To make it clear, such clusters are necessary and I’d like to see more of them. Yet they are not sufficient, we need to live interdisciplinarity. An eclectic mind, an open intellect will overcome any boundaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      <p>So are we on the right track? I think we are. Take economic policy for example: It is far more concerned with “creating clusters” and “fostering innovation” than it used to be some decades ago.<label for="sn-eu-year" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-eu-year" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> As a matter of fact, 2009 is the <em>European Year of Creativity and Innovation</em>.</span> Is that enough? If so, there would be no point in writing this essay.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, an eclectic empowerment will, if nothing else, balance the specialism-generalism ensemble. It is too easy to blame the system, hence I believe, the biggest impact comes from the individual. We must face the challenges arising from eclectic thinking. We must dare the leap to fully embrace interdisciplinarity. Only then we will truly succeed in the knowledge society of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
